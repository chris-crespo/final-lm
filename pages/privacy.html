                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>KiddyCamp Holdings Ltd. (“<strong>KiddyCamp</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”
                    or
                    “<strong>our</strong>”) is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information (i.e. any
                    information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) who visit the
                    https://KiddyCamp.com website and KiddyCamp mobile software application (collectively, the
                    “<strong>Site</strong>”) and use the services available thereon (the “<strong>Services</strong>”).
                    Amendments to this Privacy Policy will be posted to the Site and/or Services and will be effective
                    when posted. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services following the posting of any amendment
                    to this Privacy Policy shall constitute your acceptance of such amendment.</p>

                <h3>Your Consent</h3>
                <p>When you register as a user of our Site and Services, we ask for personal information that will be
                    used to activate your account, provide the Services to you, communicate with you about the status of
                    your account, and for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Your name, company name,
                    address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and certain other information
                    about you may be required by us to provide the Services or be disclosed by you during your use of
                    the Services. You will also be asked to create a user name and private password, which will become
                    part of your account information.</p>
                <p>By providing personal information to us and by retaining us to provide you with the Services, you
                    voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such personal information as specified
                    in this Privacy Policy. The legal bases for our processing of personal information are primarily
                    that the processing is necessary for providing the Services and that the processing is carried out
                    in our legitimate interests, which are further explained below. Without limiting the foregoing, we
                    may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your personal information in
                    specific circumstances.</p>

                    <li>To protect the rights, property or personal safety of you, us, our users and the public; </li>
                    <li>To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or
                        other sale or transfer of some or all of KiddyCamp’s assets, in which personal information held

                </ul>
                <p>KiddyCamp will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal
                    information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without
                    providing you notice.</p>

                <h3>Aggregated Data</h3>
                <p>We may also use your personal information to generate Aggregated Data for internal use and for
                    sharing with others on a selective basis. “Aggregated Data” means records which have been stripped
                    of information potentially identifying users, and which have been manipulated or combined to provide
                    generalized, anonymous information. Your identity and personal information will be kept anonymous in
                    Aggregated Data.</p>

                <h3>Sharing your Personal Information</h3>
                <p>KiddyCamp may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we
                    disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the
                    purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use
                    it for any purpose except performing the contract. We also take reasonable measures to ensure that
                    these third parties provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and
                    organizational measures.</p>
                <p>We share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Service providers such as Stripe and Paypal who will utilize your credit card and other payment
                        information in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</li>
                    <li>KiddyCamp’s registered API application providers, including Chrome tab extensions Panda and
                        Muz.li which deliver relevant design stories and inspiration. We invite you to review their
                        applicable data protection policies.</li>

                <h3>General Data Protection Act</h3>
                <p>Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in
                    which we engage third party service providers. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of
                    information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection
                    rules than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws
                    of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or
                    law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country.
                    However, our practices regarding your personal information will at all times continue to be governed
                    by this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the General Data Protection
                    Regulation (“GDPR”) requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal
                    information from the EU/EEA to third country.</p>
                <p>We may occasionally communicate with you regarding our products, services, news and events. You have
                    the option to not receive this information. We provide an opt-out function within all email
                    communications of this nature, or will cease to communicate with you for this purpose if you contact
                    us and tell us not to communicate this information to you. The only kind of these communications
                    that you may not “opt-out” of are those required to communicate announcements related to the
                    Services, including information specific to your Account, planned Services suspensions and outages.
                    We will attempt to minimize this type of communication to you.</p>
                <h3>Age of Consent</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly provide the Services to, and will not knowingly collect the personal information
                    from anyone under the age of consent. If you live in a country in the EU/EEA, you must be at least
                    16 years old to use our Services or such greater age required in your country to register for or use
                    our Services. If you live in any other country except those in the EU/EEA, you must be at least 13
                    years old to use our Services or such greater age required in your country to register for or use
                    our Services. In addition to being of the minimum required age to use our Services under applicable
                    law, if you are not old enough to have authority to agree to our Privacy Policy in your country,
                    your parent or guardian must agree to our Privacy Policy on your behalf. If you have any concerns
                    about your child’s personal information, please contact us at <a

                    under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe
                    we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at the email address
                    provided in the paragraph above.</p>

                    made, where applicable, as authorized or required by law. However, to make sure that the personal
                    information we maintain about you is accurate and up to date, please inform us immediately of any

                    restrict processing of your personal information, under certain conditions, if you believe we have

                    believe your personal information is inaccurate; (vi) the right to data portability of personal

                <p><u>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</u></p>
                <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights, please submit a verifiable consumer
                    request to us by emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@KiddyCamp.com">help@KiddyCamp.com</a>. Only
                    you,
                    or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your
                    behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also
                    make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable
                    consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12 month period. The verifiable
                    consumer request must: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person we
                        collected personal information on.</li>
                    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and
                        respond to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
                    identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
                    Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
                <p><u>Response Timing and Format</u></p>
                <p>We endeavor to respond to verifiable consumer requests within 45 days of receipt. If you have an
                    account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account
                    with us, we will deliver our written response to you by mail or electronically, at your option. Any
                    disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                    request’s receipt. If applicable, we will also provide reasons we cannot comply with your request.
                    For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is
                    readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information. We do not charge a fee to process
                    or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded. If we
                    determine a fee is warranted, we will provide you with an estimate before completing your request.
                </p>

                <p><u>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</u></p>
                <p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us not to sell your personal
                    information (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we
                    actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right
                    to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years or age, or the parent or
                    guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers may opt-out of future sales at any time.
                    To exercise the right to opt-out, you should not use the Services, as we are not technically able to
                    ensure that your personal data will not be “sold” (as we currently understand that term to be
                    defined under the CCPA).</p>

                <p><u>Non-Discrimination</u></p>
                <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the
                    CCPA, we will not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                    <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts
                        or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                    <li>Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                    <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
                        level of quality of goods or services.</li>
                </ul>
