                        <p><strong>(a) Arbitration of Disputes:</strong> For any claim, disputes, or controversy between
                            you and us that arises out of, is related to or connected with the goods or services you
                            acquire from or through us (individually a "Claim" and collectively "Claims"), you agree to
                            first contact the Support Team to attempt to resolve the Claim informally. We hope we can
                            resolve any Claim with you.</p>
                        <p>In the unlikely event that you and Creative Market are unable to resolve the Claim within
                            sixty (60) days after you contact us, then you and we each agree to resolve the Claim only
                            by and through binding arbitration with a single arbitrator. You and we further agree that
                            the arbitration may be administered by American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the
                            Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then
                            in effect for the AAA or, if an arbitration is not possible through AAA, through a similar
                            well-recognized nationwide arbitration administration service with similar rules.</p>
                        <p>The only exceptions to our agreement to arbitrate are as follows: (1) any and all Claims
                            related to injunctive relief and/or any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of
                            your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ Intellectual Property Rights (as discussed
                            below); (b) to the extent that arbitration clauses are prohibited by applicable law in
                            jurisdictions outside of the United States; or (c) a Claim that meets the requirements to be
                            heard in small claims court as a single-plaintiff claim (which you may bring in such a small
                            claims court at your option).</p>
                        <p>You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act encourages the arbitration of private
                            disputes in an efficient manner and shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
                            provision. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
                            interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding any arbitration rules to the contrary, if your Claim is for U.S. $10,000 or
                            less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
                            basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an
                            in-person hearing. If your Claim is for more than U.S. $10,000, at the option of either
                            party, the arbitration will be conducted at an in-person hearing.</p>
                        <p>We will advance the payment of filing fees and arbitrator’s fees and expenses, with the
                            understanding that the arbitrator will be permitted to re-allocate those costs in the award.
                        </p>
                        <p>In any arbitration, the prevailing party will not seek to recover attorney’s fees or
                            expenses. The award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and may be entered as a
                            judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent
                            either party from seeking injunctive relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the
                            actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data
                            security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.</p>
                        <p><strong>(b) Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS (AS DEFINED ABOVE)
                            MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                            PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE
                            THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Creative
                            Market ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If
                            the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a
                            dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest
                            proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 19 is found to be illegal or
                            unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 19 still applies.</p>
                        <p><strong>(c) Opt Out:</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action
                            waiver. If you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and,
                            following efforts to informally resolve any Disputes, the claim will be brought in court. To
                            opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to
                            this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username
                            and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal
                            statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, all sent to <a
                                href="mailto:optout@kiddycamp.com">optout@kiddycamp.com.</a> You must also retain a copy
                            of your opt-out notice.</p>

                        <p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> If any portion of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void or
                            unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, the Terms as a whole
                            will not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of the Terms that
                            is unlawful, void or unenforceable will be stricken from the Terms.</p>
                        <p>You agree that the Terms are specifically enforceable by kiddycamp through injunctive relief
                            and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.</p>
                        <p>You agree that if kiddycamp does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
                            contained in the Terms (or which kiddycamp has the benefit of under any applicable law),
                            this
                            will not be taken to be a formal waiver of kiddycamp’s rights and that those rights or
                            remedies will still be available to kiddycamp.</p>
                        <p>The Terms are the entire agreement between us related to the subject matter in the Terms. The
                            Terms replace and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous agreement, representation or
                            discussion, oral or written, and may not be changed except in writing signed by us,
                            regardless of whether or not the parties act under an unsigned “electronic” agreement or
                            rely on such an unsigned agreement.</p>
